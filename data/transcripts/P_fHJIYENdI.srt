1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,590
What if, all

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,170
of the world's biggest
problems from climate change,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,800
to curing diseases, to
disposal of plastic waste,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,590
what if they all had the same solution?

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,040
A solution so tiny it would be invisible.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,170
I'm inclined to believe this is possible,

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,300
thanks to a recent
breakthrough that solved one

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,000
of the biggest problems
of the last century.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,670
How to determine the
structure of a protein?

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,530
- It's been described to me as equivalent

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,410
to Fermat's last theorem, but for biology.

12
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,540
- Over six decades, tens of thousands

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,549
of biologists painstakingly worked out

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,782
the structure of 150,000 proteins.

15
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:38,670
Then in just a few years, a team of

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,990
around 15 determined the
structure of 200 million.

17
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,650
That's basically every protein
known to exist in nature.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,360
So how did they do it

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,950
and why does this have the potential

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,463
to solve problems way
outside the realm of biology?

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,610
A protein starts simply as
a string of amino acids.

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,250
Each amino acid has a
carbon atom at the center.

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,319
Then on one side is an amine group,

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
and on the other side is a carboxyl group.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,210
And the last thing it's
bonded to could be one

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,460
of 20 different side chains,

27
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,200
and which one determines which

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,593
of the 20 different amino
acids this molecule is.

29
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,130
The amine group from
one amino acid can react

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,970
with the carboxyl group of
another to form a peptide bond.

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,870
So a series of amino acids
can bond to form a string

32
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,100
and pushing and pulling

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,950
between countless molecules,
electrostatic forces,

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,470
hydrogen bonds, solvent interactions

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,770
can cause this string to
coil up and fold onto itself.

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,940
This ultimately determines the
3D structure of the protein.

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,350
And this shape is the thing

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,840
that really matters about the protein.

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,060
It's built for a specific purpose,

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,430
like how hemoglobin has
the perfect binding site

41
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,863
to carry around oxygen in your blood.

42
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,140
- These are machines, they need

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,530
to be in their correct orientation
in order to work together

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,080
to move, for example, the
proteins in your muscles.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,460
They change their shape a little bit

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,410
in order to pull and contract.

47
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,780
- But it would take people a long time

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,850
to get the structure of just one protein.

49
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,683
- Absolutely.

50
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,580
So what should proteins look like?

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,930
Was only started to answer really

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,060
with experimental techniques.

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,190
- [Derek] The first way protein
structure was determined

54
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,310
was by creating a crystal
out of that protein.

55
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,260
This was then exposed to x-rays

56
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,270
to get a diffraction pattern,

57
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,310
and then scientists would work backwards

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,780
to try to figure out what shape

59
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,543
of molecules would create such a pattern.

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,530
It took British biochemist,
John Kendrew, 12 years

61
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,660
to get the first protein structure.

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,230
His target was an oxygen storing
protein called myoglobin,

63
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,123
an important protein in our hearts.

64
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,090
He first tried a horse heart,

65
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,890
but this produced rather small crystals

66
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,920
because it didn't have enough myoglobin.

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,110
He knew diving mammals would have lots

68
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,490
of myoglobin in their muscles

69
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,890
since they're the best
at conserving oxygen.

70
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,970
So he obtained a huge chunk
of whale meat from Peru.

71
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,190
This finally gave Kendrew
large enough crystals

72
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,980
to create an x-ray diffraction image.

73
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,410
- And when it came out,
it looked really weird.

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,700
People expected something

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,310
kind of logical,
mathematical, understandable,

76
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,370
and it almost looked, I
wouldn't say ugly, but intricate

77
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,600
and complex and kind

78
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,330
of like if you see a rocket motor,

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,010
and all the parts hanging off.

80
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,697
- [Derek] This structure,
which has been called

81
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,370
"Turd of the century,"

82
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,153
won Kendrew, the 1962
Nobel Prize in chemistry.

83
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,520
Over the next two decades,

84
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,850
only around a hundred more
structures were resolved.

85
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,990
Even today, protein crystallization
remains a big challenge.

86
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,790
- Frankly it is not uncommon

87
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,070
that just a couple protein structures

88
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,690
can be someone's entire PhD.

89
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,200
Sometimes just one, sometimes
even just progress toward one,

90
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,460
- And it's expensive.

91
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,100
X-ray crystallography
can cost 10s of thousands

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,110
of dollars per protein.

93
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,820
So scientists sought another way

94
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,380
to work out protein structure.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,570
It only costs around a hundred dollars

96
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,240
to find a protein sequence of amino acids.

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,070
So if you could use this to figure out

98
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,480
how the protein would fold,

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,110
that would save a lot of
time, effort, and money.

100
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,520
I kind of know how carbon behaves

101
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,140
and I know how carbon sticks to a sulfur

102
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,780
and how that might stick
next to a nitrogen.

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,710
And if these ones are here,

104
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,930
then I can imagine this one
folding, making that bond there.

105
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,640
So it seems like if you have some sense

106
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,630
of basic molecular dynamics,
you might be able to figure out

107
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,800
how this protein's gonna fold.

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,230
- One of the few true
predictions in biology

109
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,260
was actually Linus Pauling
looking at just the geometry

110
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,337
of the building blocks of proteins

111
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,880
and saying, actually they
should make helices and sheets.

112
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,470
That's what we call secondary structure,

113
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,800
the very local kind of twists
and turns of the protein.

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,570
- But beyond helices and sheets,

115
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,840
biochemists could not figure
out any reliable patterns

116
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,200
that would lead to the final
structure of all proteins.

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,440
One reason for this is that
evolution didn't design proteins

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,730
from the ground up.

119
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,860
- It's kind of like a programmer

120
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,030
that doesn't know what they're doing,

121
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,990
and whenever it looked good,

122
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,550
they just kept adding that kind of thing.

123
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,960
And that's how you end up

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,610
with these both amazing objects

125
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,010
and incredibly complex
and hard to describe.

126
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,040
They don't have purpose
underneath them in the same way

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,970
as like a human designed machine would.

128
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,460
- [Derek] To illustrate just
how complicated this process

129
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,640
can get, MIT biologist Cyrus Levinthal did

130
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,680
a back-of-the-envelope calculation,

131
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,930
and he showed that even
a short protein chain

132
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,330
with 35 amino acids can fold

133
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,793
in an astronomical number of ways.

134
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,480
So even if a computer checked
the energy instability

135
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,660
of 30,000 configurations every nanosecond,

136
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,960
it would take 200 times
the age of the universe

137
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,943
to find the correct structure.

138
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,660
Refusing to give up,

139
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,700
the University of Maryland
professor John Moult

140
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,630
started a competition called CASP in 1994.

141
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,600
The challenge was simple,
to design a computer model

142
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,520
that could take an amino acid sequence

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,710
and output its structure.

144
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,440
The modelers would not
know the correct structure

145
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,040
beforehand, but the output from
each model would be compared

146
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,533
to the experimentally
determined structure.

147
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,860
A perfect match would
get a score of a hundred,

148
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,560
but anything over 90 was
considered close enough

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,810
that the structure was solved.

150
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,480
CASP competitors gathered
at an old wooden chapel

151
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
turned conference center
in Monterey, California,

152
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,910
and at any point where a
prediction didn't make sense,

153
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,540
they were encouraged to tap
their feet as friendly banter.

154
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,849
There was a lot of foot tapping.

155
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,680
(foot tapping)

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,290
In the first year, teams
could not achieve scores

157
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,000
higher than 40.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,270
The early front runner was
an algorithm called Rosetta,

159
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,050
created by University of
Washington biologist David Baker.

160
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,660
One of his innovations
was to boost computation

161
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,870
by pooling together processing
power from idle computers

162
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,990
in homes, schools, and
libraries that volunteered

163
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,440
to install his software
called Rosetta at Home.

164
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,090
- As part of it, there was a screensaver

165
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,440
that showed basically the course

166
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,650
of the protein folding calculation.

167
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,810
And then we started getting
people writing in saying

168
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,730
that they were watching the screensaver

169
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,550
and they thought they could
do better than the computer.

170
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,350
- So Baker had an idea.

171
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,487
He created a video game.

172
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,640
(upbeat music)

173
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,110
The game called Fold It,

174
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,510
set up a protein chain capable of twisting

175
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,970
and turning into different arrangements.

176
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,940
- But now instead of the
computer making the moves,

177
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,220
the game players, the
humans could make the moves.

178
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,300
- Within three weeks,

179
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,400
more than 50,000 gamers pooled

180
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,140
their efforts to decipher an enzyme

181
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,600
that plays a key role in HIV.

182
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,720
X-Ray crystallography showed
their result was correct.

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,310
The gamers even got credited

184
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,323
as co-authors on the research paper.

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,800
Now, one man who played Fold It

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,340
was a former child chess
prodigy named Demis Hassabis.

187
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,180
Hassabis had recently started
an AI company called DeepMind.

188
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,880
Their AI algorithm, AlphaGo made headlines

189
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,690
for beating world champion
Lee Sedol at the game of Go.

190
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,690
One of AlphaGo's moves, move
37, shook Sedol to his core.

191
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,720
But Hassabis never forgot about
his time as a Fold It gamer.

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
- So of course I was fascinated this

193
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,750
just from games design perspective.

194
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,880
You know, wouldn't it be
amazing if we could mimic

195
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,940
the intuition of these gamers
who were only, by the way,

196
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,130
of course, amateur biologists.

197
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,870
- After returning from Korea,

198
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,030
DeepMind researchers had
a week-long hackathon

199
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,270
where they tried to
train AI to play Fold It.

200
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,270
This was the beginning of
Hassabis' longstanding goal

201
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,700
of using AI to advance science.

202
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,520
He initiated a new
project called Alpha Fold

203
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,713
to solve the protein folding problem.

204
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,920
Meanwhile at CASP, the quality

205
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,450
of prediction from the best performers,

206
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,240
including Rosetta had plateaued.

207
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,723
In fact, the performance went
downhill after CASP eight.

208
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,360
The predictions weren't good enough,

209
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,830
even with faster computers

210
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,330
and a growing number of structures

211
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,193
in the protein data bank to train on.

212
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,093
DeepMind hoped to change
this with AlphaFold.

213
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,540
Its first iteration, AlphaFold 1,

214
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,060
was a standard off-the-shelf
deep neural network like

215
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,880
the ones used for computer
vision at that time.

216
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
The researchers trained it on lots

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,580
and lots of protein structures
from the protein data bank.

218
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,060
As input, AlphaFold took the
protein's amino acid sequence

219
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,883
and an important set of
clues given by evolution.

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,810
Evolution is driven by mutations,

221
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,160
changes in the genetic code,

222
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,440
which in turn change the amino acids

223
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,600
within a given protein sequence.

224
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,690
But as species evolve, proteins
need to retain the shape

225
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,270
that allows them to perform
their specific function.

226
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,720
For instance, hemoglobin looks
the same in humans, cats,

227
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,150
horses, and basically any mammal.

228
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,270
Evolution says, if it
ain't broke, don't fix it.

229
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,950
So we can compare sequences

230
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,170
of the same protein
across different species

231
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,793
in this evolutionary table.

232
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,190
Where sequences are similar,

233
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,870
it's likely they are important

234
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,120
in the protein structure and function.

235
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,160
But even where the
sequences are different,

236
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,090
it's helpful to look at where
mutations happen in pairs

237
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,700
because they can identify
which amino acids

238
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,550
are close to each other
in the final structure.

239
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,760
Say two amino acids, a
positively charged lysine

240
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,700
and a negatively charged
glutamic acid attract

241
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,610
and hold each other in the folded protein.

242
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,800
Now, if a mutation changes lysine

243
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,080
to a negatively charged amino acid,

244
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,060
it would repel glutamic acid

245
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,250
and destabilize the whole protein.

246
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,550
Therefore, another mutation
must replace glutamic acid

247
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,340
with a positively charged amino acid.

248
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,860
This is known as co-evolution.

249
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,210
These evolutionary tables

250
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,733
were an important input for AlphaFold.

251
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,250
As output, instead of directly
producing a 3D structure,

252
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,760
AlphaFold predicted a simpler
2D pair representation

253
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,020
of that structure.

254
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,550
The amino acid sequence

255
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,980
is laid out horizontally and vertically.

256
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,870
Whenever two amino acids are close

257
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,400
to each other in the final structure,

258
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,553
their corresponding row
column intersection is bright.

259
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,603
Distant amino acid pairs are dim.

260
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,170
In addition to distances,

261
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,600
the pair representation
can also hold information

262
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,120
on how amino acid molecules are twisted

263
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,170
within the structure.

264
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,230
AlphaFold 1 fed the protein sequence

265
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,320
and its evolutionary table
into its deep neural network,

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,170
which it had trained to predict
the pair representation.

267
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,500
Once it had this, a
separate algorithm folded

268
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,090
the amino acid string based

269
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,640
on the distance and torsion constraints.

270
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,373
And this was the final
protein structure prediction.

271
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,110
With this framework,
AlphaFold entered CASP 13

272
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,080
and it immediately turned heads.

273
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,680
It was the clear winner
after many additions,

274
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,720
but it wasn't perfect.

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,610
Its score of 70 was not enough

276
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,743
to clear the CASP threshold of 90.

277
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
DeepMind needed to get
back to the drawing board

278
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,140
to get better results.

279
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,203
So Hassabis recruited John
Jumper to lead AlphaFold.

280
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,980
- AlphaFold 2 was really
a system about designing

281
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,120
our deep learning.

282
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,210
The individual blocks to be
good at learning about proteins,

283
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,320
have the types of geometric
physical, evolutionary concepts

284
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,630
that were needed and put it
into the middle of the network

285
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,860
instead of a process around it.

286
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,380
And that was a tremendous accuracy boost.

287
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,040
- [Derek] There were three key steps
to get better results with AI.

288
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
First, maximum compute power.

289
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,930
Here, DeepMind was
already better positioned

290
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,180
than anybody in the world.

291
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,060
It had access to the enormous
computing power of Google,

292
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,313
including their tensor processing units.

293
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,660
Second, they needed a
large and diverse data set.

294
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,200
Is data the biggest roadblock and why?

295
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,960
- I think it's too easy to
say data's the roadblock

296
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,793
and we should be careful about it.

297
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:37,740
AlphaFold 2 was trained on
the exact same data with much,

298
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,430
much better machine
learning as AlphaFold 1.

299
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,160
So everyone overestimates
the data blockage

300
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,840
because it gets less severe
with better machine learning.

301
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,010
- [Derek] And that was the third key
element, better AI algorithms.

302
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,040
Now AI is not just good
at protein folding.

303
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,750
It can do all kinds of tasks

304
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,850
that no one likes from writing emails

305
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,620
to answering phone calls.

306
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,950
Something I hate is building
and maintaining a website.

307
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,680
It's so much work from
optimizing the website

308
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,900
for different platforms,
finding a good design

309
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,840
so it looks professional
to constantly updating it

310
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,260
with new information about
the business as it grows.

311
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,270
That's why we partnered with Hostinger,

312
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,370
the sponsor of today's video.

313
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,980
Hostinger makes it super
easy to build a website

314
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,390
for yourself or your business.

315
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,020
And with their advanced AI
tools, you can simply describe

316
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,090
what you want your website to look like.

317
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,260
And in just a few seconds,

318
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,170
your personalized website
is up and running.

319
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,870
Hostinger is designed to
be as easy as possible

320
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,520
for beginners and professionals.

321
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,230
So any tweaks you need to make

322
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,330
after that are super easy too.

323
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,890
Just drag and drop any pictures

324
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,110
or videos you want, where you want them,

325
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,180
or just type what you want to say

326
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,950
or have the AI help you here too,

327
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,690
if writing isn't your thing either.

328
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,820
And if you still want that
human touch, Hostinger

329
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,960
is always available

330
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,990
with 24/7 support if you

But when you're done building
in just a few clicks,

332
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,740
your website is live.

333
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,290
It's all incredibly
affordable too, with a domain

339
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,910
I wanna thank Hostinger for sponsoring

340
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,870
this part of the video.

341
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,733
And now back to protein folding.

342
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,540
As the AlphaFold 2 team
searched for better algorithms,

343
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,340
they turned to the transformer.

344
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,950
That's the T in ChatGPT.

345
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,100
And it relies on a
concept called attention.

346
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,933
In the sentence,

347
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:39,450
the animal didn't cross the
street because it was too tired.

348
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,300
Attention recognizes
that it refers to animal

349
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,750
and not street based on the word tired.

350
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,380
Attention adds context to any
kind of sequential information

351
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,510
by breaking it down into chunks,

352
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,730
converting these into
numerical representations

353
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,910
or embeddings and making
connections between them.

354
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,030
In this case, the word it and animal.

355
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,860
3Blue1Brown has a great series

356
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,073
of videos specifically about
transformers and attention.

357
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,950
Large language models use attention

358
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,860
to predict the most appropriate
word to add to a sentence,

359
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,740
but AlphaFold also has
sequential information,

360
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,100
not sentences, but amino acid sequences.

361
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,150
And to analyze them,

362
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,460
the AlphaFold team built their own version

363
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,073
of the transformer called an EVO Former.

364
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,790
The EVO Former contained two towers,

365
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,520
evolutionary information
in the biology tower

366
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,090
and pair representations
in the geometry tower.

367
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:36,180
Gone was AlphaFold 1's deep
neural network that started

368
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,400
with one tower and predicted the other.

369
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,620
Instead, AlphaFold 2's EVO Former

370
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,480
builds each tower separately.

371
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,550
It starts with some initial guesses,

372
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,150
evolutionary tables taken from
known data sets as before,

373
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,560
and the pair representations

374
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,960
based on similar known proteins.

375
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,690
And this time there's a bridge
connecting the two towers

376
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,350
that conveys newly found
biological and geometry clues

377
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,030
back and forth.

378
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,260
In the biology tower,

379
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,390
attention applied on a column identifies

380
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,540
amino acid sequences
that have been conserved.

381
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,390
While along a row, it
finds amino acid mutations

382
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,070
that have occurred together.

383
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,490
Whenever the EVO Former finds
too closely linked amino acids

384
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,900
in the evolutionary table.

385
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,210
It means they are important to structure

386
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,910
and it sends this information
to the geometry tower.

387
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,440
Here attention is applied

388
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,410
to help calculate distances
between amino acids.

389
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,590
- There's also this thing
called triangular attention

390
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,270
that got introduced,

391
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,410
which is essentially about letting

392
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,270
triplets attend to each other.

393
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,160
- [Derek] For each triplet of amino acids,

394
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,920
AlphaFold applies the triangle inequality.

395
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,490
The sum of two sides must
be greater than the third.

396
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,320
This constrains how far apart

397
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,840
these three amino acids can be.

398
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,317
This information is used to
update the pair representation,

399
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,450
- And that helps the model produce like

400
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,840
a self-consistent
picture of the structure.

401
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,340
- [Derek] If the geometry
tower finds it's impossible

402
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,680
for two amino acids to
be close to each other,

403
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,030
then it tells the first tower

404
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,510
to ignore their relationship
in the evolutionary table.

405
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,150
This exchange of information
within the EVO Former

406
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,069
goes on for 48 times,

407
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,249
until information within
both towers is refined.

408
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,440
The geometrical features
learned by this network

409
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,160
are passed onto AlphaFold
2's second main innovation,

410
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,750
the structure module.

411
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,920
- For each amino acid,

412
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,980
we pick three special
atoms in the amino acid

413
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,569
and say that those define a frame.

414
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,669
And what the network does is it imagines

415
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,160
that all the amino acids
start out with the origin

416
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,230
and it has to predict the
appropriate translation

417
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,300
and rotation to move these frames

418
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,040
to where they sit in the real structure.

419
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,170
So that's essentially what
the structure module does.

420
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,990
- But the thing that sets
the structure module apart

421
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,880
is what it doesn't do.

422
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,130
- Previously, people might
have imagined that you would

423
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,490
like to encode the fact that
this is a chain, you know,

424
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,790
and that certain residue
should sit next to each other.

425
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,220
We don't really explicitly
tell AlphaFold that.

426
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,220
It's more like we give
it a bag of amino acids

427
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,770
and it's allowed to position
each of them separately.

428
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,040
And some people have
thought that that helps it

429
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,520
to not get stuck in terms of
where things should be placed.

430
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,380
It doesn't have to always be
thinking about the constraint

431
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,030
of these things forming a chain,

432
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,640
that's something that
emerges naturally later.

433
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,980
- [Derek] That's why live
AlphaFold folding videos

434
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,493
can show it doing some
weirdly non-physical stuff.

435
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,980
The structure module outputs a 3D protein,

436
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,870
but it still isn't ready.

437
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,000
It's recycled at least three more times

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,580
through the Evo Former to
gain a deeper understanding

439
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,333
of the protein only then the
final prediction is made.

440
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,360
In December, 2020, DeepMind
returned to a virtual CASP

441
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,920
with AlphaFold 2, and
this time they did it.

442
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,537
- I'm going to read an
email from John Moult.

443
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:50,340
"Your group has performed
amazingly well in CASP 14,

444
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,350
both relative to other groups

445
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,840
and in absolute model accuracy.

446
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,450
Congratulations on this work."

447
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,090
- [Derek] For many proteins,
AlphaFold 2 predictions

448
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,930
were virtually indistinguishable
from the actual structures

449
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,323
and they finally beat the
gold standard score of 90.

450
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,470
- For me, having worked
on this problem so long,

451
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,050
after many, many stops and starts,

452
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,880
and suddenly this is a solution.

453
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
We'd solved the problem.

454
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,280
This gives you such excitement
about the way science works.

455
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,100
- [Derek] Over six decades,
all of the scientists working

456
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,010
around the world on
proteins painstakingly found

457
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,670
about 150,000 protein structures.

458
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,940
Then in one fell swoop, AlphaFold came in

459
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,630
and unveiled over 200 million of them.

460
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,620
Nearly all proteins
known to exist in nature.

461
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,770
In just a few months,
AlphaFold advanced the work

462
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,043
of research labs worldwide
by several decades.

463
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,020
It has directly helped us
develop a vaccine for malaria.

464
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,090
It's made possible the breaking down

465
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,070
of antibiotic resistance enzymes,

466
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,340
which make many life-saving
drugs effective again.

467
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,540
It's even helped us understand

468
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,830
how protein mutations lead

469
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,800
to various diseases from
schizophrenia to cancer,

470
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,690
and biologists studying little known

471
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,640
and endangered species suddenly

472
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,763
had access to proteins
and their life mechanism.

473
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,740
The AlphaFold 2 paper has
been cited over 30,000 times.

474
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,320
It has truly made a step function leap

475
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,913
in our understanding of life.

476
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,540
John Jumper and Demis
Hassabis were awarded one half

477
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,900
of the 2024 Nobel Prize in
chemistry for this breakthrough.

478
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,000
The other half went to David Baker,

479
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,700
but not for predicting
structures using Rosetta.

480
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,410
Instead, it was for designing

481
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,170
completely new proteins from scratch.

482
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,240
- It was really hard to
make brand new proteins

483
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,320
that would do things.

484
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,510
And so that's kind of the
problem that we solved.

485
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,630
- To do so, he uses the
same kind of generative AI

486
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,630
that makes art in programs like Dall-E.

487
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,770
- You can say draw a picture

488
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,210
of a kangaroo riding on a rabbit

489
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,628
or something, and it will do that.

490
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,560
And so it's exactly what
we did with proteins.

491
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,680
- His technique called
"RF Diffusion" is trained

492
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,800
by adding random noise to
a known protein structure,

493
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,830
and then the AI has to remove this noise.

494
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,290
Once trained in this
way, the AI can be asked

495
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,660
to produce proteins for various functions.

496
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,760
It's given a random noise input,

497
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,730
and the AI figures out a brand new protein

498
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,430
that does what you asked it to do.

499
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,950
This work has huge implications.

500
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,819
I mean, imagine you got
bitten by a venomous snake.

501
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,070
If you're lucky, you'll have
access to anti-venom prepared

502
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,130
by milking venom from
the exact kind of snake,

503
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,100
which is then injected into live animals,

504
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,800
and the antibodies from
that animal are extracted

505
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,610
and refined and then given
to you as an anti-venom.

506
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,340
The trouble is often people
have allergic reactions

507
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,890
to these antibodies from other organisms.

508
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,780
But your odds of survival
can be a lot better

509
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,200
with the latest synthetic
proteins designed in Baker's lab.

510
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,570
They've created human
compatible antibodies

511
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,120
that can neutralize lethal snake venom.

512
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
This anti-venom could be
manufactured in large quantities

513
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,990
and easily transported to
the places where it's needed.

514
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,940
With these tiny molecular machines,

515
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,950
the possibilities are endless.

516
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,380
What are the applications
you're most excited about?

517
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,930
- So I think vaccines are
gonna be really powerful.

518
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,100
We have a number of proteins

519
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,260
that are in human clinical
trials for cancer,

520
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,180
and we're working on
autoimmune disease now.

521
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,950
We're really excited about problems

522
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,570
like capturing greenhouse gases.

523
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,920
So we're designing enzymes

524
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,640
that can fix methane, break down plastic.

525
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,890
- What makes this approach so effective is

526
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,550
how fast they can create
and iterate the proteins.

527
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,440
- It's really quite miraculous

528
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,840
for anyone who's a
conventional school biochemist

529
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,190
or protein scientist.

530
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,830
We can now have designs on the computer,

531
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,530
get the amino acid sequence
of the design proteins,

532
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,060
and then in just a couple days
we can get the protein out.

533
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,320
Yeah. We've given a name to this,

534
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,210
which is "Cowboy Biochemistry"

535
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,750
because we just like, you
just got kind of go for it

536
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,050
as fast as you can, and it
turns out to work pretty well.

537
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,840
- What AI has done for
proteins is just a hint

538
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,880
of what it can do in other fields

539
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,070
and on larger scales.

540
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,840
In materials science, for example,

541
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,220
DeepMind's GNoME program has
found 2.2 million new crystals,

542
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,250
including over 400,000 stable materials

543
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,900
that could power future technologies

544
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,840
from superconductors to batteries.

545
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
AI is creating transformative
leaps in science

546
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,240
by helping to solve some
of the fundamental problems

547
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,550
that have blocked human progress.

548
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,320
- If we think of the
whole tree of knowledge,

549
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,550
you know there are certain problems

550
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,530
where you know if their root, no problems.

551
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,870
If you unlock them, if you
discover a solution to them,

552
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,100
it would unlock a whole new
branch or avenue of discovery.

553
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,430
- And with this, AI is
pushing forward the boundaries

554
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,760
of human knowledge at a
rate never seen before.

555
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,860
- Speed ups of 2x are nice,

556
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,810
they're great, we love them.

557
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,250
Speed ups of a 100,000x, change what you do.

558
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,800
You do fundamentally different stuff

559
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,740
and you start to rebuild your science

560
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,350
around the things that got easy.

561
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,780
- And that's what I'm excited about.

562
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,600
These discoveries represent
real step function

563
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
changes in science.

564
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,920
Even if AI doesn't advance
beyond where it is today,

565
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,690
we will be reaping the benefits

566
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,000
of these breakthroughs for decades.

567
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,520
And assuming AI does continue to develop,

568
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,320
well, it will open up opportunities

569
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,390
that were previously thought impossible.

570
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,940
Whether that's curing all diseases,

571
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,380
creating novel materials,

572
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,430
or restoring the environment
to a pristine state.

573
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,790
This sounds like an amazing future as long

574
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,639
as the AI doesn't take over
and destroy us all first.

575
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,722
(slow cosmic music)
